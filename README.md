# DataModel(data_model)

A Flutter package that adds some upgrades to the regular data models.

## Getting Started

Simply, implement the abstract class, DataModel, to your current data model.
Override the required fields and methods.
Now you have access to .save() and .load() methods directly within your data model.
loadDB() method returns an index to the database that include your "DataModel"s names
and corresponding ids.


This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
